✓ DESCRIPTION
Bitcoin Money (BCM) is a Solana-based token designed to combine the advantages of Bitcoin - such as limited supply and decentralization - with the high transaction speeds and low fees offered by the Solana blockchain.

BCM aims to be an efficient digital payment tool and a store of value in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem. With a maximum supply of 21 million tokens - inspired by Bitcoin - BCM offers high scalability for everyday transactions, making it a modern alternative for users looking for a combination of value stability and network performance.
✓ KEY FEATURES Transaction Speed: Leverages Solana for processing thousands of transactions per second.
✓ LOW FEES Minimal gas fees compared to other blockchains such as Ethereum.
✓ INTEROPERABILITY
Compatible with SPL wallets (e.g. Phantom, Sollet) and can be integrated into DeFi applications on the Solana ecosystem.

✓ LIMITED SUPPLY
Total supply is capped at 21 million BCM to maintain scarcity and potential long-term value.

✓ USE CASE
~ Cross-border peer-to-peer payments with low fees.
~ Digital store of value as an alternative to Bitcoin on a faster network.
~ Used in staking or liquidity pools on Solana-based DeFi platforms.
